# ============================================
# GitHub Pages Deployment with GA4 Secret Injection
# Replaces GA Measurement ID placeholder with secret value during deployment
# ============================================
# 
# IMPORTANT: After adding this workflow, you need to:
# 1. Go to Settings → Pages → Build and deployment
# 2. Change "Source" from "Deploy from a branch" to "GitHub Actions"
# 3. This workflow will then handle all deployments
#
# If you prefer to keep branch-based deployment, see alternative in docs

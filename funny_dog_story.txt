The Great Sock Heist of 2026
============================

Once upon a time, there was a golden retriever named Biscuit who had 
one mission in life: to collect every sock in the house.

It started innocently enough. A sock here, a sock there. But soon, 
Biscuit's collection grew to legendary proportions. Under his dog bed 
lay a treasure trove of 47 socks - none of them matching.

His owners were baffled. "Where do all our socks go?" they wondered, 
buying new packs every week.

Biscuit would sit there, tail wagging, the picture of innocence, 
while secretly plotting his next heist.

One fateful Tuesday, he got greedy. He tried to steal a sock RIGHT 
OFF his owner's foot while they were watching TV.

"BISCUIT!" 

The chase was on. Through the kitchen, around the couch, under the 
dining table - Biscuit ran with that sock flapping like a victory flag.

He made it to his bed and dove underneath, adding sock #48 to his 
collection with pride.

His owner lifted the bed and gasped. "MY LUCKY ARGYLE SOCKS! I'VE 
BEEN LOOKING FOR THOSE FOR THREE YEARS!"

Biscuit just wagged his tail and burped.

From that day forward, they called him "The Sock Bandit" - and he 
wore that title with honor.

THE END

(Biscuit is now in sock rehabilitation. He's down to only stealing 
socks on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Progress!)

║     THE LEGENDARY TALE OF NUTSWORTH THE CODE SQUIRREL           ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Once upon a time, in a repository far, far away (specifically C:\appdev\telecode),
there lived a peculiar squirrel named Nutsworth McFluffytail III.

Nutsworth wasn't your ordinary squirrel. While other squirrels hoarded acorns,
Nutsworth hoarded... Git commits.

"Why store nuts for winter," he'd say, adjusting his tiny glasses,
"when you can store BEAUTIFUL, SEMANTIC COMMITS?"

One fateful Tuesday, Nutsworth discovered a bug in the codebase.

"GREAT WHISKERS!" he shrieked, his bushy tail standing straight up.
"Someone forgot a semicolon! THE HORROR! THE ABSOLUTE CHAOS!"

He immediately opened a pull request titled:
"URGENT: Semicolon Emergency - This Is Not a Drill 🚨"

The code review comments were legendary:

  @Nutsworth: "This missing semicolon has kept me up for 3 nights.
               I've stress-eaten 47 acorns. My therapist is concerned."
  
  @DevHuman: "It's JavaScript. Semicolons are optional."
  
  @Nutsworth: "OPTIONAL?! *flips tiny squirrel table* 
               EVERYTHING I KNOW IS A LIE!"

From that day forward, Nutsworth became the unofficial guardian of the repo.
He'd scurry through the branches (git branches, not tree branches),
leaving helpful comments like:

  "This function is nuttier than my acorn stash. Refactor pls. 🐿️"
  
  "Have you considered... NOT using 47 nested callbacks? Just a thought."
  
  "This variable name 'x' tells me nothing. Unlike my acorn labels:
   'Winter Emergency', 'Really Good One', 'Found Behind Carl's Tree'."

The developers grew to love their fuzzy code reviewer.

They even added a special command in his honor:
  /squirrel-approve - Adds a 🐿️ emoji to approved PRs

Legend has it, if you're ever stuck on a bug at 3 AM, you might hear
a tiny voice whisper: "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"

And if you look closely at your terminal, you might see a fluffy tail
disappear behind a stack trace.

THE END

P.S. - Nutsworth's Rules of Coding:

1. Always commit early, commit often (like hiding acorns - you never know!)
2. Comments should explain WHY, not WHAT (squirrels already know WHAT)
3. If your code is messier than a squirrel's nest, refactor it
4. When in doubt, add more unit tests (and acorns)
5. Never push to main on a Friday (that's acorn-counting day)

🐿️ "May your code be bug-free and your stash be plentiful!" 🐿️

The Great Keyboard Heist

Mr. Whiskers had one mission: conquer the keyboard.

He waited until his human started an important email. Then he struck.

First, he sat on the spacebar. "aaaaaaaaaaaa" filled the screen.

His human sighed. "Move, cat."

Mr. Whiskers rolled over, accidentally sending the email to the CEO.

It read: "Dear Sir, aaaaaaa cat butt aaaaaaa regards."

The CEO replied: "Finally, an honest email. Promoted."

Mr. Whiskers purred. Another successful day of helping.

His human stared at the screen in disbelief.

The cat winked.

THE END

THE GREAT HAY HEIST
A Tale of Harold the Horse and His Mouse Mates

Harold was no ordinary horse. While other horses stood majestically in fields 
looking noble, Harold preferred to practice his stand-up comedy routines to 
an audience of three mice who lived in his hay bale: Whiskers, Nibbles, and 
their self-appointed leader, a very serious mouse named Gerald.

"Why did the horse go behind the tree?" Harold asked one sunny afternoon.

"To change his jockeys!" squeaked Nibbles, who had heard this one forty-seven times.

Gerald adjusted his tiny spectacles (stolen from a doll's house) and sighed.
"Harold, we need to discuss something important."

"More important than comedy? Impossible!"

"The farmer," Gerald said gravely, "is selling your hay bale. OUR hay bale. 
Tomorrow. To the goat farm down the road."

Harold gasped. "Those goats are RUDE! They don't laugh at ANY of my jokes!"

The mice huddled together. A plan was needed.

The next morning, farmer Jenkins came to collect the hay bale, only to find 
Harold lying dramatically across it, tongue hanging out.

"HAROLD! What's wrong with you, boy?!"

Harold didn't move. Gerald, hidden in Harold's mane, whispered: "Stay still! 
I'm deploying Phase Two!"

Whiskers and Nibbles burst from the hay wearing tiny ghost costumes made from 
tissues. They ran in circles squeaking "WooOOooo!" in the most threatening way 
three-inch-tall mice could manage.

Farmer Jenkins stared. "Are those... ghost mice?"

Harold couldn't help it. He snorted. Then giggled. Then absolutely LOST it, 
rolling onto his back with his legs kicking in the air, wheezing with laughter.

"THE HORSE IS POSSESSED!" Jenkins screamed, running back to the farmhouse.

---

When he returned with his wife, they found Harold standing normally, the hay 
bale mysteriously relocated behind the water trough, and three mice sitting 
in a row wearing tiny sunglasses, looking extremely casual.

"Nothing to see here," Gerald squeaked, though of course the humans only 
heard "squeak squeak squeak."

Harold winked at his tiny friends. "Same time tomorrow for the talent show?"

The mice high-fived. Harold had to use his tail because, well, hooves.

And thus, the hay bale stayed exactly where it was, home to three small mice 
and their ridiculous horse friend who never did learn when to quit joking.

THE END

(Gerald still hasn't returned those spectacles to the doll's house. 
He says they make him look "distinguished.")
